# What is a network

- a system of links that interconnect nodes in order to exchange information
- two type of nodes:
- 
  - hosts: sources and sinks of information
  - Router: relay nodes that simply forward information

# packet vs circuits

- Internet is a packet switching network.

# ip: the glue of the internet
- hosts and routers are tied together by ip(internet protocol),a single common interface between users and the network and between networks.

# hierarchical addressing
- DNS is a distributed directory system that translates names into ip address.

# osi system interconnection(OSI)

# router forward packets
- routers determine the next hop for a packet based on the destination ip address.
- routing algorithms ensure packets follow the shortest path
